## Introduction

Biometric signals, such as heart rate and EEG, are often collected during AR/VR experiences for various purposes, including user monitoring and personalization. VRGuard aims to offer a comprehensive solution to protect the privacy of users by providing tools and techniques to:

- Anonymize biometric data.
- Encrypt data during transmission.
- Implement access control mechanisms.
- Detect and prevent unauthorized access.
- Monitor data integrity.

By using VRGuard, developers, researchers, and AR/VR content creators can ensure that biometric data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.

## Features

The `Features` directory contains Python scripts for extracting relevant features from biometric signals within the context of AR/VR applications. These features include:

- Entropy calculations.
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) extraction.
- P,Q,R,S,T points in ECG signals

These scripts are essential for preprocessing and analyzing biometric data.

## Utils

The `Utils` directory contains utility functions and modules that assist in various aspects of the privacy protection process. These utilities are designed to streamline data handling, encryption, and access control operations within the AR/VR environment.

## Installation
